## The core highlights ​

**Deep optimization, performance improvement** Equipped with a full-year H3 quad-core processor, the **deep-custom FlyOS & Klipper firmware** is significantly optimized for instruction processing and print performance.

**Out of the box, ecologically complete** Pre-install all the necessary plug-ins and components, eliminating complex debugging and significantly reducing the time from installation to first printing.

**One-click update, support OTA** Support for online system updates (OTA), no need to reburn firmware, sustainable access to the latest features and security patches.

## Information on purchase and use ​

Important: About Storage

Fly-Pi-lite2.1 **does not come with storage devices** and must prepare your own memory card to use:

*   It is recommended to use a **16GB–128GB** capacity Micro SD (TF) card with a speed rating of C10 and above.

Important: About Electricity

**Fly-Pi-lite2.1 does not support powering it via an undercarriage (such as a motherboard).** The upper machine must be powered by a separate 5V power adapter, otherwise it may cause device damage or work abnormally.
